# Atlas Messenger for Android

Atlas Messenger is a fully-featured messaging app following [Material Design guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-goals), built on top of the [Layer SDK](https://layer.com/), using the [Atlas UI toolkit](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-Android).

## <a name="setup"></a>Setup

Run `git submodule update --init` to initialize and pull in the [Atlas-Android](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-Android) submodule.

## <a name="structure"></a>Structure

* **App:** Application class.
* Activities:
  * **BaseActivity:** Base Activity class for handling menu titles and the menu back button and ensuring the `LayerClient` is connected when resuming Activities.
  * **ConversationsListActivity:** List of all Conversations for the authenticated user.
  * **MessagesListActivity:** List of Messages within a particular Conversation.  Also handles message composition and addressing.
  * **SettingsActivity:** Global application settings.
  * **ConversationDetailsActivity:** Settings for a particular Conversation.
* **PushNotificationReceiver:** Handles `com.layer.sdk.PUSH` Intents and displays notifications.
* **AuthenticationProvider:** Interface used by the Messenger app to authenticate users.  Default implementation is provided; see *provider* below.

## <a name="identityproviders"></a>Identity Providers

Atlas Messenger uses the `AuthenticationProvider` interface to authenticate with various backends.  Additional identity providers can integrate with Atlas Messenger by implementing `AuthenticationProvider` and using a custom login Activity.

### <a name="provider"></a> Provider
To use the sample app, you need to register your app on the [Dashboard] (https://developer.layer.com) and follow the guide to deploy the [Sample Identity Provider](https://github.com/layerhq/layer-identity-provider) backend on Heroku. In assets/LayerConfiguration.json, update the "name" and "app_id" to the values displayed on the dashboard; update the "identity_provider_url" to the URL of the sample app you deployed on Heroku.

`[
  {
    "name": null,
    "app_id": null,
    "identity_provider_url": null
  }
]`

Learn more about the authentication flow [here] (https://docs.layer.com/sdk/android/authentication).

### <a name="pushnotifications"></a>Push Notifications

In order to build Atlas-Messenger, you must generate a `google-services.json` file so push notifications will be enabled. If this is not done, the Gradle build will fail with the error: `File google-services.json is missing. The Google Services Plugin cannot function without it.`

To do this, please follow the push notification setup steps [here](https://docs.layer.com/sdk/android/push).

#### To Disable Notification
* Remove the `google-services` plugin in the necessary `build.gradle` files.
* Set `options.useFirebaseCloudMessaging(true)` to false in `App.generateLayerClient()`
